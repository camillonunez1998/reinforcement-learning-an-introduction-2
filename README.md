# Sutton & Barto Exercise Solutions

This repository contains my personal Sutton & Barto exercise solutions. Each subfolder contains a pdf file with questions and answers and python scripts for programming exercises.   

Solutions are for personnel reference. No guarantee of correctness is provided. 

Corrections are welcome...

I also created  [rl-algo](https://github.com/habanoz/rl-algo) repository for RL Control algorithm implementations.
